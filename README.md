Canvas Context
==============

A Rails app that fetches from and stores stories, videos, and galleries from the [Al Jazeera API](http://developer.aljazeera.com/content_api/apis). Also includes user login layer, where logged-in users can favorite resources.

The API is still under early development, so it is subject to change (and possibly break) at any time.
